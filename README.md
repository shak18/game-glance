# Game Glance

A [Decky Loader](https://decky.xyz) plugin for Steam's Game Mode. It turns each game's page into a full-screen view
with everything about the game at a glance (how long it takes to beat, how far you are, what it is about and where it
came from), and can replace Steam's Home with **Spotlight Home**: your games, one at a time, over their own art.

## The game page

- **Full-screen art.** The game's hero art fills the screen (your custom SteamGridDB art when you have set some).
  Steam's Activity, Your stuff, Community and Game info tabs are one press down.
- **HowLongToBeat.** Main story, Main + Extras and 100% times, a bar toward the next one you have not reached, and
  how many hours are left.
- **Info card.** Your play time, achievements and the game's description, in your Steam language.
- **Play row.** A pill-shaped Play button (with the "Play from" arrow some games have), round controller and settings
  buttons, and Steam Cloud as a small icon coloured by its sync state.
- **Store pill.** Where the game comes from, with the store's icon: Steam, GOG, Epic, Amazon, Battle.net, Ubisoft,
  Xbox Cloud or Heroic. A game borrowed through **Steam Families** gets a second pill with the owner's name
  ("Family Sharing · Grave").
- **Clean look** (optional): only the art and one row at the bottom (Play, the buttons, and a small card with your play
  time, achievements and HowLongToBeat's main story), without the description and HowLongToBeat cards.
- **Non-Steam games.** Games added by [Heroic](https://heroicgameslauncher.com) or
  [Unifideck](https://github.com/mubaraknumann/unifideck) get their store, times and description too. A Unifideck game's
  page looks and works like a Steam game's: its Play row in the same place, the buttons in Steam's order, its own play
  time, last played and install size (in Unifideck's language), and its cloud saves.
- **Works offline.** Times and descriptions are kept on the device. Quick Access can pre-load them for every installed
  game, and new installs are picked up automatically.

With Spotlight Home on (or the Clean look), the page takes Spotlight Home's look: the game's title or logo with "Last
played" under it, just above a larger Play row in the game's colour, and the status bar at the top. With both off, the
page keeps its classic look.

## Spotlight Home

![Spotlight Home on a TV: the game's logo, its chips, Play and the games row](docs/images/tv-home-logo.jpg)

An optional new Home screen, off by default (Quick Access → Game Glance → Spotlight Home).

- **One game at a time.** The selected game fills the screen with its art, its title (or logo) and when you last played
  it, chips for play time, achievements and HowLongToBeat's main story, a Play button and the game's buttons. The
  accent colour follows each game's art. The chips are filled in ahead of time for every game in the row, so they are
  there the moment you land on a game.
- **The games row.** Your recent games (up to 20, as many as Steam's own Home), or one of your collections (see Games
  row below). Games new to your library join the recent games, marked NEW. The selected game opens into a wide card;
  the row ends in a Library card.
- **Controls.** Left and Right pick a game, A opens its page, up reaches Play and the buttons. **L1 and R1** pick the
  previous or next game from anywhere above the tabs and put focus on Play (hold to keep going), so a game starts in two presses. The
  gear button, or View/Select, opens Steam's own menu for the game.
- **Steam Cloud.** For games with cloud saves, Steam's and Unifideck's, a cloud button shows the sync state and opens
  Steam's sync dialog when there is a problem.
- **Status bar.** The time (12 or 24 hours, as set in Steam's Settings → System), battery (a bolt while charging, red
  under 20%), Wi-Fi or wired, and a dot for your own online status, at the top right, on Home and the game page. It steps aside for Steam's own top bar when you move up
  to it or open a Steam menu.
- **Press down for more.** Home itself stays clean; one press down brings up three tabs (L1 and R1 switch between them,
  with Steam's tab sound):
  - **What's new:** news for your games, and the games recently updated on this device.
  - **Friends:** your friends, in game first, then online, away and offline; A on a friend in a game you can join asks,
    then joins them. Under them, the games popular among your friends, with their pictures.
  - **Recommended:** Play next from your library, and, with Show wishlist deals on, up to six wishlist games on sale
    (the new price, then the old one struck through).
- **Safe.** If anything in Spotlight Home fails, you get Steam's own Home instead of a broken screen.

## Settings

Quick Access (…) → Game Glance:

| Setting | Default | What it does |
|---|---|---|
| Game Glance page | On | The full-screen game page. Off gives Steam's own game page. |
| Clean look | Off | The game page with only the art and one row at the bottom. |
| Spotlight Home | Off | The new Home, and its look on the game page. Off returns Steam's Home at once. |
| Status bar | On | The clock, battery, connection and online status at the top right. |
| Game logo | Off | The game's logo in place of its name, on Home and the game page. A game without a logo keeps its name. Each logo is cropped to its artwork and sized so that wide and compact logos look about equally big. |
| Games row | Recent Games | What Home's row shows: your recent games, or one of your Steam collections (Favorites, Locally Installed Games and your own). With a collection, **Sort By** offers Last Played, Alphabetical or Date Added to Library, and the line under the title starts with the collection's name. |
| Show wishlist deals | Off | Wishlist games on sale in the Recommended tab (see Privacy). |
| Pre-load new games automatically | On | Fetches times and descriptions for new installs, every 30 minutes. |

Also in Quick Access:

- **HowLongToBeat match:** if a game matches the wrong entry or none, paste its HowLongToBeat link.
- **Pre-load game info for installed games:** fetches times and descriptions for every installed game, about one per
  second. A game that does not answer is skipped, and Stop ends it at once.
- **Clear cached data.**
- **Updates:** the installed version, **Update to …** when a newer release is out, and **Check for updates**.

## Your language

Game Glance follows Steam's language and uses Steam's own words wherever Steam has them ("Última sesión" and "Tiempo de
juego" in Spanish, the collection and sort names, the cloud states and more). Unifideck's labels come from Unifideck. A
few words with no Steam equivalent stay in English: the HowLongToBeat column names and this Quick Access panel (see
[docs/localization.md](docs/localization.md)).

## Install

Game Glance is not in the Decky plugin store. Install it from a release:

1. In Game Mode, open Decky → Settings → General and turn on **Developer mode**.
2. Download `game-glance.zip` from the [latest release](../../releases/latest).
3. Decky → Settings → Developer → **Install plugin from ZIP** (or **Install plugin from URL** with the release asset's
   link).

**Updates install from Game Mode** (from 2.1 on): Game Glance checks for a new release once a day, and Quick Access →
Game Glance → Updates shows **Update to …**, which hands it to Decky to confirm, install and reload Game Glance.

If you use **HLTB for Deck**, you can uninstall it; Game Glance shows the same times on the game page.

## Compatibility

Tested on a ROG Xbox Ally running Bazzite, handheld and docked to a 1080p TV; the layout follows the screen size. It
should work on a Steam Deck and other SteamOS-like devices, but that has not been tested.

Steam updates can rename the parts of the page Game Glance styles. When that happens, it turns its layout off and you
get Steam's normal page with the cards on it, rather than a broken page.
[docs/device-checklist.md](docs/device-checklist.md) lists what to check after an update.

Known limits: Steam keeps no "last played" game for friends, so Game Glance remembers the last game it saw each friend
play and shows it once they are away or offline.

## Privacy

Game Glance talks to two sites for game data: howlongtobeat.com (times) and store.steampowered.com (descriptions). It
sends game names and Steam app IDs, nothing about you.

- **Show wishlist deals** (off by default) is the one exception: it sends your Steam ID to Steam's web API
  (api.steampowered.com) to read your public wishlist, then asks the store for the prices of its games by app ID.
- **Updates:** once a day, and when you press Check for updates, Game Glance asks api.github.com for the latest release's
  version and download link. It sends nothing about you; an update is only downloaded, by Decky, when you press Update.
- **From the Steam client:** Spotlight Home's news, friends, status bar and art, and the family owner's name (from your
  friends list). Art, logos and news images Steam has not stored on the device yet load from Steam's image servers, as
  on Steam's own Home.

Everything Game Glance stores stays on the device, in Decky's settings folder.

## Development

```bash
pnpm install
pnpm test                         # frontend tests
python3 -m venv .venv && .venv/bin/pip install pytest && .venv/bin/pytest tests/py
pnpm check:hltb                   # live check against howlongtobeat.com
scripts/package.sh                # builds out/game-glance.zip
```

A release is a GitHub release tagged `vX.Y.Z` (the version in `package.json`) with `out/game-glance.zip` attached as
`game-glance.zip`; the built-in updater compares that tag with the installed version. Release notes are in
[docs/release-notes](docs/release-notes).

`scripts/serve.sh` serves the zip on your network for **Install plugin from URL**. The `scripts/cef-*.mjs` helpers
drive Steam's UI through remote CEF debugging; see the device checklist for the setup.
